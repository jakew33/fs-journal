# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > Git allows you to work in parallel with other developers. It gives you the option to revert back to an older version of your code, and allows you to create branches.
    It seems like it makes life easier when working on group projects. 

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > It's used to create a new directory 

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A pseudo-class is added to a selector that specifies a special state of that element. 
    :link :hover :after :before

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity determines which rule should be applied in the chance that multiple rules are targeting both the same element and property on that element, but assigning different values. It can be useful to find out what takes priority in the load order.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > it can take priority over things you didn't intend it to and mess up your code

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > A selector, a property and a value

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > I think people respond positivley to a clean and easy to navigate website, and makes them more likely to return. You can convey a specififc mood and atmosphere through color and font choices.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > From what I understand, wireframing is building your application from a a sort of blueprint.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > I think they have the potential to be. It could help you visualize and focus what you need to make before just diving into something.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > It creates a flex container and turns its elements into flex elements

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > box-sizing, border, padding

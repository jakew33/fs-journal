# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  The staff are really nice and welcoming. Everyone in my class seems easy to talk to. The lectures are interesting and well presented, and the teachers are good a breaking down concepts that would have gone over my head.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
  I knew this was going to be difficult, and the second day made me realize I need to spend basically all my free time studying if I want to keep up.

- What are you struggling with?
  I understand and can follow what's going on during the lectures, but when I'm on my own I know what I have to do, but a hard time knowing knowing how to implement it properly without out the days examples to reference. Which is obviously not great.

- What would you count as a victory?
  The frog game made bootstrap suprisingly easier to grasp.
